#Group Project, ‘FHAT-IIMN’ International Institute of Minnesota
A client-focused finance application
•	Our client, IIMN, has a one-hour client-interview window to complete twenty-one pages of document questionnaires gathering financial and lifestyle information from Minnesota refugees and immigrants.  This has proven to be an ineffective process. Our group has designed a web application with a simple user interface allowing initial client inputs then dynamically displaying appropriate follow up questions. This allows IIMN staff to complete their interviews in a time efficient and streamlined process and, in addition, enables required reporting data easily transferable into Salesforce ensuring continued non-profit status.
•	Our team of four co-authored a full-stack JavaScript web app strongly focused on SOLID and Object-oriented programming principles.  
•	MongoDB, Express, AngularJS-Material-UI-Router-Chart, AngularFire, Node.js, Firebase, json2csv, JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3.
